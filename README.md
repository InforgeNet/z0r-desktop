# z0r-desktop
The Windows App for z0r.it (by inforge.net)

This app lets you copy any link in your clipboard and then shrink it with z0r.it just pressing ALT+Z (or any shortcut you like).

z0r.it is a URL Shortener create by inforge.net using YAOURLS (that you can find on GitHub).


Feel free to contribute!


# TODO:
1. Add the ability to change the key shortcut for shrinking.
2. Add a regex to check against non-link texts in clipboard.
