# z0r-desktop
**The Windows App for z0r.it** *(by inforge.net)*

This app lets you copy any link in your clipboard and then **shrink it with z0r.it** just pressing *ALT+Z* (or any shortcut you like).

**z0r.it is a _URL Shortener_** created by *inforge.net* using **YAOURLS** (that you can find on *GitHub*).

*z0r-desktop is written in _VB.NET_*.

Feel free to contribute!


## TODO:
1. Add the ability to change the key shortcut for shrinking.
2. Add a regex to check against non-link texts in clipboard.
3. ...
